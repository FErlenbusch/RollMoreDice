# RollMoreDice

This project is a spring backend that creates JSON api endpoints for a D&D character manager web app. 

This project was built as my first attempt at building a Spring backend. The project was used as a Group Project submission for CS1530: Software Engineering, where I designed and developed the back-end and api endpoints contained in this repo, and my team members built the front-end that utilized it.
